# Pre-Workshop Homework

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes  
**When to Complete:** Before Workshop 1

## Overview

Before attending Workshop 1, you'll need to set up your development environment and learn some basic concepts. This homework ensures everyone starts on the same page!

## What You'll Do

1. **Set up Arduino Cloud** (15 min) - Create your development environment
2. **Learn basic electronics concepts** (10 min) - Understand voltage, current, and circuits
3. **Get familiar with the ESP32** (5 min) - Know your microcontroller
4. **Write your first sketch** (10 min) - Test your setup

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Electronics Basics

Learn about:
- Voltage (V) - electrical pressure
- Current (A) - flow of electricity
- Resistance (Ω) - opposition to current
- Basic circuit components
