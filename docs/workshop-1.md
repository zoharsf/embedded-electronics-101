# Workshop 1: Basics & First Circuit

**Duration:** 1.5 hours  
**Difficulty:** Beginner

## What You'll Build

Two interactive circuits:
1. **LED Blink** - Your first circuit with a blinking LED
2. **LED + Button** - Interactive circuit where a button controls an LED

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
- Build circuits on a breadboard
- Connect LEDs with proper resistors
- Wire buttons with proper pull-down configuration
- Write Arduino code for digital input/output
- Debug basic circuit issues

## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Understanding the Hardware (15 min)
- ESP32 pinout and capabilities
- Breadboard basics and power rails
- Component identification

### Part 2: LED Blink Circuit (30 min)
- Build your first circuit
- Upload the blink code
- Understand the code structure
- Modify timing and experiment

### Part 3: Adding a Button (30 min)
- Add button to your circuit
- Learn about INPUT_PULLDOWN mode
- Write interactive code
- Test and debug

### Part 4: Experimentation (15 min)
- Try different LED patterns
- Add multiple LEDs
- Explore button debouncing

## What's Next?

After Workshop 1, complete the [Inter-Workshop Homework](inter-workshop.html) to prepare for Workshop 2!

## Extension Challenges

Want to go further? Try these:
1. **Multiple LEDs** - Add 2 more LEDs and create patterns
2. **Button Counter** - Count button presses and display with LEDs
3. **Reaction Game** - LED lights up randomly, press button quickly!
4. **Morse Code** - Blink messages in Morse code
