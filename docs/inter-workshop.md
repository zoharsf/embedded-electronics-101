# Inter-Workshop Homework

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes  
**When to Complete:** Between Workshop 1 and Workshop 2

## Overview

This homework prepares you for Workshop 2, where you'll work with sensors to read real-world data. You'll learn about different types of sensors and practice modifying code.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Sensor Basics** (15 min) - How sensors work and common types
2. **Code Tweaking** (20 min) - Practice modifying Arduino sketches
3. **Project Selection** (10 min) - Choose your Workshop 2 project

## Detailed Materials

### 1. Sensor Basics

Learn about the sensors in your kit:
- **DHT11** - Temperature and humidity sensor
- **LDR** - Light-dependent resistor (measures light)
- How analog and digital sensors differ
- Reading sensor datasheets

### 2. Code Tweaking Practice

Get comfortable modifying existing code:
- Change timing values
- Modify thresholds
- Add new variables
- Experiment with logic

### 3. Project Selection

Choose which project you'll build in Workshop 2:
- **Project 1:** Sensor Logger - Log temp/humidity data
- **Project 2:** LED Light Show - Create patterns with multiple LEDs
- **Project 3:** Button Game - Reaction timer or Simon Says
- **Project 4:** Data Dashboard - Advanced Python visualization
