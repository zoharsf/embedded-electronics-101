## Reading (15 minutes)

- [ ] Read: [Electronics Basics 101](/0-pre-workshop/01-basics.md) (15 min)

## Setup (10 minutes)

- [ ] Follow: [Arduino IDE Setup](/0-pre-workshop/02-arduino-setup.md)
- [ ] Create Arduino account ✅
- [ ] Install ESP32 board support ✅
- [ ] Select "ESP32 Dev Module" board ✅

## Quick Knowledge Check (Optional)

Answer these in your head (no need to submit):

1. **What are the 3 core concepts?**
   - Answer: Voltage (push), Current (flow), Resistance (brake)

2. **LED polarity: which leg is positive?**
   - Answer: Long leg = positive

3. **Why do we use resistors with LEDs?**
   - Answer: Limit current so LED doesn't burn out

4. **What does `pinMode(2, OUTPUT)` do?**
   - Answer: Sets pin 2 to output mode (we'll control it)

5. **What's the difference between setup() and loop()?**
   - Answer: setup() runs once, loop() runs forever

## 🎉 Done?

**Congratulations!** You're officially prepared for Workshop 1.

You now know:
- ✅ What microcontrollers are
- ✅ How electronics basics work
- ✅ How to use Arduino IDE
- ✅ What a sketch is

### What to Bring to Workshop 1

- ✅ Your laptop/computer
- ✅ USB-C cable (for charging your laptop if needed)
- ✅ **Nothing else!** We provide all the electronics kits

### What NOT to Worry About

- ❌ Don't stress about memorizing everything
- ❌ Don't worry if some concepts are fuzzy
- ❌ You don't need to install anything on your machine (Arduino Create is web-based!)
- ❌ You won't be tested on anything

## Still Stuck?
