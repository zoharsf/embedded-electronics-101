# 📖 Pre-Workshop Homework (30-45 minutes)

**Do this BEFORE Workshop 1.** Estimated time: **30-45 minutes total.**

No hardware needed yet—we'll give you your kit at Workshop 1!

## What You'll Do

1. ✅ Watch a quick microcontroller intro (5 min)
2. ✅ Learn electronics basics (15 min)
3. ✅ Set up Arduino IDE (10 min)
4. ✅ Complete the checklist (5 min)

**Total: ~35-45 minutes**

## Why Pre-Workshop Homework?

This saves **30+ minutes during Workshop 1**, so we can spend more time actually building circuits instead of explaining basics.
