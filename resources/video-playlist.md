## Pro Tips for Video Learning

1. **Pause and rewind** - Don't worry about getting it all in one watch
2. **Watch multiple videos on same topic** - Different explanations click differently
3. **Speed up if you're comfortable** - YouTube's 1.25x/1.5x speed is great
4. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts
5. **Rewatch before workshops** - Your brain needs reinforcement!

## Can't Find a Video?

Videos get deleted or moved sometimes. If a link is broken:
1. Search YouTube for the topic name
2. Look for channels like:
   - Paul McWhorter (beginner-friendly)
   - Electronic Wizard (clear explanations)
   - Science Buddies (practical focus)
3. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/zoharsf/embedded-electronics-101/issues) and we'll find a replacement!
