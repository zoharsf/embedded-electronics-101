# 🎯 Workshop 1: Basics & First Circuit (1.5 hours)

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- ✅ Understand how circuits work
- ✅ Build your first real circuit (LED + button)
- ✅ Write code to control hardware
- ✅ Troubleshoot when things don't work
- ✅ Know how to extend this to more complex projects

## 📋 What You'll Build

**A button-controlled LED circuit:**
- Push the button → LED lights up
- Release the button → LED turns off
- (Bonus) Hold button 2+ seconds → LED blinks

## 🚨 If Something Doesn't Work

**First: Check the troubleshooting guide**
→ [Workshop 1 Troubleshooting](/1-workshop-1/troubleshooting.md)

**Still stuck?**
→ Open an [Issue](https://github.com/zoharsf/embedded-electronics-101/issues) with:
- What you tried
- What error you got
- A photo of your circuit (if possible)

## 🎯 After Workshop 1

You'll get **inter-workshop homework** to:
- Learn about sensors (DHT11, light sensor)
- Pick which project you want to build in Workshop 2

**Start here when you get it:**
→ [Inter-Workshop Homework](/2-inter-workshop/)
